Strategic Inflection Points
Andrew Grove
Link:

- Fundamental change in the well-being of a business and / or industry
- Exactly at the inflection point -> business changes in a sutile but profound manner (talent vs genius)
- No adjustment at the inflection point -> decline
- 6 competitive forces
    - Existing competitors
    - Complementors -> who make your product more valuable
    - Customers
    - Suppliers -> forces of substitution
    - Substitutes
    - Potential competitors
- What happens when one of these forces becomes 10x the others
- Nature of the industry (the fundamental business model) changes
    - Personal computer -> cost was the 10x force
        - Industry changed from vertically integrated to modular [!! and back again with the re-emergence of Apple silicon]
- Time in between business models -> Valley of Death
- Retailer -> future home of Walmart
    - Walmart is tuned to generate thin margins, technology
    - It is a 10x force
- Regulatory changes (e.g. AT&T monopoly)
- Internet
    - Phenomenon coming [talk was in 1996!] -> even if not aware
- Very often the first sign comes from the front line
    - [?? what happens to signals that come from the top, like GenAI today]
    - e.g. Vodafone / Microsoft (something changed 10 years ago)
    - What is changing now?
- Strategic Dissonance
    - Field raises issues about stated strategy execution
    - Middle managers "out of sync"
    - New behaviors -> new strategy
- Tell tale signs
    - Difference between what a company does (field) and what it says it does (management)
- Fundamental change in business strategy
- Innovation and modification of core competencies
- Signal or noise?
    - Entirely dependant on context
    - Example RISC (did not work in the 80s -> ARM)
        - Was 2-3x improvement
    - Risk of damaging relationships and losing people
- Getting through the "valley of death"
    - Confusing -> stories do not make sense
    - Let chaos rule (management fights dispersion and brings cohesion)
    - Ambiguity resolved through watching experiments unfold
    - Decide what is going to be done
- Managing through strategic inflection points
    - Move to acceptance and action before it becomes too late
    - Accept implied strategy -> develop newly stated strategy
- Career advice
    - Watch for strategic inflection points
    - Separate signal from noise
    - Experiment first
    - Pull in the reins and commit
    - Maintain discipline and overcome denial
